## PROJECT
This project develops a **wireless sensor network** in order to inform fire stations for the environmental conditions in large forest areas.<br />
A beacon (device that contains temperature, moisture, soil moisture and fire sensors) is placed in a certain area in the forest.<br />
This beacon receives an availability message for each fire station.<br />
In case a fire station is available, the beacon transmits environmental conditions every 15 mins, otherwise (fire station unavailability) it stops transmitting information.<br />
For this project we used:
- 2 arduino boards.
- 2 RFM22 tranceivers.
- 1 temperature sensor.
- 1 moisture sensor.
- 1 soil moisture sensor.
- 1 fire sensor.

For the communication between the 2 nodes, we used the ALOHA protocol.<br />
This repo consists of the code and the report of the project written in Greek. <br />
